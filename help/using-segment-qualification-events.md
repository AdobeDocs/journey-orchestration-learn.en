# Using segment qualification events

A segment qualification event allows your journey to listen to the entrances and exits of profiles in Adobe Experience Platform segments in order to make individuals enter or move forward in a journey.

Example use cases could be:

* A journey is triggered for a mobile service customer, when they exceed their data limit
* When a customer reached a new loyalty segment or drops out of a loyalty segment

This video gives you a brief introduction on where to configure segments and how to configure a Segment Qualification event in a journey.
