# Using segment qualification events

A segment qualification event allows your journey to listen to the entrances and exits of profiles in Adobe Experience Platform segments. This event type is used to make individuals enter or move forward in a journey.

Example use cases could be:

* A journey is triggered for a mobile service customer, when they exceed their data limit
* When a customer reached a new loyalty segment or drops out of a loyalty segment

This video gives you a brief introduction on where to configure segments and how to configure a Segment Qualification event in a journey.
