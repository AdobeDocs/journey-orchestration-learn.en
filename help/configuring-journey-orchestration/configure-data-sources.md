# Configure data sources

[!UICONTROL Journey Orchestration] allows you to connect to Adobe Experience Platform or other third-party data sources to retrieve additional information that can be used in a journey for:

* Definition of conditions
* Parameters and personalization data in actions
* [!UICONTROL Custom timer] definition
* Custom timezone definition

This configuration is not required if your journey's only leverage local data coming from an event payload.

The following video explains how to: Configure an Experience Platform data source and an external data source, as well as how to find and use data in a journey.
