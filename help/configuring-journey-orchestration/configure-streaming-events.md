# Configure streaming events

[!UICONTROL Journey Orchestration] listens to events and orchestrates the best next actions within the customer's journey based on these events. An event can relate to:

* An individual's direct actions (for example, they bought a product, visited a store, or abandoned an online shopping cart), or
* Something that happened that is connected to the individual (for example, they reached 10,000 loyalty points)

[!UICONTROL Journey Orchestration] events are [!UICONTROL XDM experience events] that are sent to the Adobe Experience Platform via [!UICONTROL streaming ingestion].
